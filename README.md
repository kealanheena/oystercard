# Oystercard Challenge

This week's challenge will start with going back over the basics I covered last week in Boris Bikes, giving me the chance to reinforce what I learned last week. I'll then be challenged to build a more complex system which should really stretch my skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

### Station class

- #initialize
  - should create a class instance of the station name
